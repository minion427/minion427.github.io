        <!-- Good: A List Apart Website -->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a></h3>
            <p>A List Apart focuses on web design and development, known for its clean, readable, and well-structured design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent contrast between black/gray text and a white background. Links are clearly distinguishable.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent typography and color scheme across pages, with elements like the header and footer repeating throughout.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All elements are well-aligned with clear, consistent spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements such as navigation links and content are grouped logically, enhancing usability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <!-- Bad: Zombo.com Website -->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://www.zombo.com/" target="_blank">Zombo.com</a></h3>
            <p>Zombo.com is an intentionally chaotic website that lacks any basic design principles, but it provides a unique case study in "what not to do".</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Poor contrast with neon gradients and text that's hard to read, making the site visually overwhelming.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent typography and layout across pages. No repeated design elements or cohesive style.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Misaligned text and elements make the page look disorganized. No structured design whatsoever.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Information is scattered all over the page, with no logical grouping of related content. Navigation and content feel disconnected.</li>
            </ul>
