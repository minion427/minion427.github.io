        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I’m an exchange student from South Korea for this semester.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> I’ve tutored Korean SAT for high school senior, worked as a RA at my home university.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> Senior</li>
            <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b> I never used html, css, js before but have experience in Python, C, and C++. More focused on the theoretical part of Computer Science, but it’s really time to focus on programming.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b>  My Windows laptop</li>
            <li>
                <b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITSC 2600 - CS Programs, Identity, Career:</b> Although I’m a senior in my home university, I still don’t have an idea about what I want to do as a computer scientist. I wanted to get a glimpse of how to prepare for my future career.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Web Application Design and Development:</b> Starting something new is always too hard for me, so I wanted to get in a class that pushes me to learn about web programming.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering:</b> This course is required for my graduation. Also, I wanted to experience the coworking system in the US.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS 4114 - Real World Algorithms:</b> I haven’t really coded for a year and a half, and lost confidence in coding. I wanted to review the data structures and learn about implementing core algorithms, and connect it to the real world situations in this course.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3688 - Comp & Their Impact on Society:</b> One of the reasons I had lost interest in coding and computer science was because I felt sarcastic about the positive impact of Computer Science on our society. I wanted to face that problem in myself and really take a deep dive into the impacts of my major into society.</li>
                    <li><b>DANC 2227 - Contemporary Jazz Dance:</b> As an exchange student for only this semester, I wanted to experience something new, something that I wasn’t brave enough to try in my hometown. Also, I love musicals and this class teaches us lots of choreography for famous musicals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> If you have a hard time pronouncing my name, you can think of it as g1.</li>
            <li><b>I'd also like to Share:</b> I practiced my English listening skills with Gilmore Girls, my favorite American TV series.</li>
