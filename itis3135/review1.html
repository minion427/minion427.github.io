        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed(primary page)</li>
            <li>There are some capital letters used for two draw.io.png files, but other than that, all the other files follow the naming convention - no capitals, no spaces.</li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>mostly sufficient contrast/font sizing easy to read, except for that yellow and white feels like lack of contrast</li>
                    <li>Has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file</li>
                    <li>CRAP
                        <ol>
                            <li>little lack of contrast between yellow and white, but it keeps the delightful mood of the website</li>
                            <li>Using repetition to keep the site connected</li>
                            <li>Generally well organized, but would've been better if there was more space for the edge materials</li>
                            <li>Good proximity
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
